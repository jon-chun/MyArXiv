Despite the\nadvancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a\nperformance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We\ntry to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance\nand any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual\ntokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens,\nwe propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution\nrefinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a\nhigh-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and\nreasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In\ngeneral, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current\nframeworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.\nMini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs)\nfrom 2B to 34B.

This model-specific setup is a substantial limitation on\nthe very modularity that modular architectures are trying to achieve. We ask\nwhether current modular approaches are transferable between models and whether\nwe can transfer the modules from more robust and larger PLMs to smaller ones.\nIn this work, we aim to fill this gap via a lens of Knowledge Distillation,\ncommonly used for model compression, and present an extremely straightforward\napproach to transferring pre-trained, task-specific PEFT modules between\nsame-family PLMs. Moreover, we propose a method that allows the transfer of\nmodules between incompatible PLMs without any change in the inference\ncomplexity.

More recently, attention has shifted to debiasing pre-trained\nlanguage models. We study to what extent the simplest projective debiasing\nmethods, developed for word embeddings, can help when applied to BERT's\ninternal representations. Projective methods are fast to implement, use a small\nnumber of saved parameters, and make no updates to the existing model\nparameters. We evaluate the efficacy of the methods in reducing both intrinsic\nbias, as measured by BERT's next sentence prediction task, and in mitigating\nobserved bias in a downstream setting when fine-tuned. To this end, we also\nprovide a critical analysis of a popular gender-bias assessment test for\nquantifying intrinsic bias, resulting in an enhanced test set and new bias\nmeasures. We find that projective methods can be effective at both intrinsic\nbias and downstream bias mitigation, but that the two outcomes are not\nnecessarily correlated.

To\nbenchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to\ngenerate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38\ntopics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for\nlong-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality\nEvaluator (SAFE).

Furthermore,\nwe propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.\nTo do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response\n(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter\nrepresenting a user's preferred response length (recall).\n  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating\nperformance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced\nhuman annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement\ncases, SAFE wins 76% of the time.

The\ncomparative method, one of the most influential theoretical and methodological\nframeworks in the history of the language sciences, allows linguists to infer\nprotoforms (reconstructed ancestral words) from their reflexes (related modern\nwords) based on the assumption of regular sound change. Not surprisingly,\nnumerous computational linguists have attempted to operationalize comparative\nreconstruction through various computational models, the most successful of\nwhich have been supervised encoder-decoder models, which treat the problem of\npredicting protoforms given sets of reflexes as a sequence-to-sequence problem.\nWe argue that this framework ignores one of the most important aspects of the\ncomparative method: not only should protoforms be inferable from cognate sets\n(sets of related reflexes) but the reflexes should also be inferable from the\nprotoforms. Leveraging another line of research -- reflex prediction -- we\npropose a system in which candidate protoforms from a reconstruction model are\nreranked by a reflex prediction model.

Our core idea is to initially train a bi-encoder on the\nlabeled source data, and then, to adversarially train two separate document and\nclaim encoders using unlabeled target data. We then focus on the reader\ncomponent and propose to train it such that it is insensitive towards the order\nof claims and evidence documents. Our empirical evaluations support the\nhypothesis that such a reader shows a higher robustness against distribution\nshift. To our knowledge, there is no publicly available multi-topic fact\nchecking dataset. Thus, we propose a simple automatic method to re-purpose two\nwell-known fact checking datasets. We then construct eight fact checking\nscenarios from these datasets, and compare our model to a set of strong\nbaseline models, including recent domain adaptation models that use GPT4 for\ngenerating synthetic data.\n","authors":["Payam Karisani","Heng Ji"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18671v1.pdf","comment":"NAACL 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18667v1","updated":"2024-03-27T15:11:00Z","published":"2024-03-27T15:11:00Z","title":"Improving Content Recommendation: Knowledge Graph-Based Semantic\n  Contrastive Learning for Diversity and Cold-Start Users","summary":"  Addressing the challenges related to data sparsity, cold-start problems, and\ndiversity in recommendation systems is both crucial and demanding.

A common trend in these\napproaches focuses on improving ranking performance at the cost of escalating\nmodel complexity, reducing diversity, and complicating the task. It is\nessential to provide recommendations that are both personalized and diverse,\nrather than solely relying on achieving high rank-based performance, such as\nClick-through Rate, Recall, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-task\nlearning approach, training on user-item and item-item interactions. We apply\nitem-based contrastive learning on descriptive text, sampling positive and\nnegative pairs based on item metadata. Our approach allows the model to better\nunderstand the relationships between entities within the knowledge graph by\nutilizing semantic information from text. It leads to more accurate, relevant,\nand diverse user recommendations and a benefit that extends even to cold-start\nusers who have few interactions with items. We perform extensive experiments on\ntwo widely used datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Inspired by the recent success of language\nfoundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal\nTrajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort\nof question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression\nmodels, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,\nwe consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first\ntransform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural\nlanguage space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are\nconverted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text\ninformation through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data\nare then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language\nmodel. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning\nhigh-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between\npedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We\nthen train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the\ntokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to\ncapture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.\nLastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of\nthe question-answer prompts.

Most of the existing works focus on improving\nthe representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token\nand calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder.

To\nbenchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to\ngenerate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38\ntopics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for\nlong-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality\nEvaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into\na set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a\nmulti-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search\nand determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore,\nwe propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.\nTo do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response\n(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter\nrepresenting a user's preferred response length (recall).\n  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating\nperformance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced\nhuman annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement\ncases, SAFE wins 76% of the time.

Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g.,\ncontent, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant\nchallenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into\nindividual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them\nindividually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with\nnovel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot\nway. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector\nquantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content,\nprosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion\nmodel to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding\nprompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and\nefficiently model intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a\ndivide-and-conquer way.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,\nwe show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by\n$\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,\n$\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the\nadaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size\ntuning.

The threat of backdoor attacks on\ntraditional deep neural networks typically comes from time-invariant data.\nHowever, in FedNL, unknown threats may be hidden in time-varying spike signals.\nIn this paper, we start to explore a novel vulnerability of FedNL-based systems\nwith the concept of time division multiplexing, termed Spikewhisper, which\nallows attackers to evade detection as much as possible, as multiple malicious\nclients can imperceptibly poison with different triggers at different\ntimeslices. In particular, the stealthiness of Spikewhisper is derived from the\ntime-domain divisibility of global triggers, in which each malicious client\npastes only one local trigger to a certain timeslice in the neuromorphic\nsample, and also the polarity and motion of each local trigger can be\nconfigured by attackers.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks. The results demonstrate that the visual tokens obtained by HOOK\ncorrespond to individual objects, which demonstrates homogeneity. HOOK\noutperformed Patch Embed by 6\\% and 10\\% in the two tasks and achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines used for comparison.\nCompared to Patch Embed, which requires more than one hundred tokens for one\nimage, HOOK requires only 6 and 8 tokens for sparse and dense tasks,\nrespectively, resulting in efficiency improvements of 1.5 to 2.8 times.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, proposed a\nstandard method for ET0 computation (FAO56PM), based on the parameterization of\nthe Penman-Monteith equation, that is widely adopted in the literature. To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty. For this reason, several ET0\nestimation models using machine and deep learning were developed and presented\nin the literature, that use as input features a reduced set of carefully\nselected weather parameters, that are compatible with common freely available\nWFSs. However, most studies on this topic have only evaluated model performance\nusing data from weather stations (WSs), without considering the effect of using\nweather forecast data. In this study, the performance of authors' previous\nmodels is evaluated when using weather forecast data from two online WFSs, in\nthe following scenarios: (i) direct ET0 estimation by an ANN model, and (ii)\nestimate SR by ANN model, and then use that estimation for ET0 computation,\nusing the FAO56-PM method. Employing data collected from two WFSs and a WS\nlocated in Vale do Lobo, Portugal, the latter approach achieved the best\nresult, with a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging between 0.893 and\n0.667, when considering forecasts up to 15 days.\n","authors":["Pedro J.

Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant\nframes and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose\ntokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model\nefficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster\n(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic\ndiversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and\nself-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for\nthis task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains\nrich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in\nthe images.

Existing world models are autoregressive in that they\ninterleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the\npolicy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows.\nIn this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not\nautoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass\nthrough a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion\n(PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the\naction distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random\nstates and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the\nconnections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and\nclassifier-guided diffusion models.

For\nshort trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive\ndiffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories,\nPolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines.

In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning\nin stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a\npartially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals.\nSpecifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in\nLinear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially\nordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal\ngoals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred\npolicy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated\nprobability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most\npreferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first\nstep, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over\ntemporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which\nis a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the\nsecond step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to\ncomputing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed\nfrom the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic\nordering relation.

In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For\ninstance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on\nthe route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the\nfuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation\nlearning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model\nbut are also dependent on a cost-constrained model.

We find that Gemini is highly accurate in\nperforming object detection, which is arguably the most common and fundamental\ntask in image analysis for political scientists. Equally important, we show\nthat it is easy to implement as the entire command consists of a single prompt\nin natural language; it is fast to run and should meet the time budget of most\nresearchers; and it is free to use and does not require any specialized\nhardware. In addition, we illustrate how political scientists can leverage\nGemini for other image understanding tasks, including face identification,\nsentiment analysis, and caption generation.

Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve\nnot only for communication but also for various machine learning applications,\nsuch as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc.\nHowever, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large\nvolume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited\ncontact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes). Therefore, federated\nlearning (FL) has emerged as the promising solution to address this problem via\non-device training. Unfortunately, to enable FL on LEO satellites, we still\nface three critical challenges that are i) heterogeneous computing and memory\ncapabilities, ii) limited uplink rate, and iii) model staleness. To this end,\nwe propose FedSN as a general FL framework to tackle the above challenges, and\nfully explore data diversity on LEO satellites. Specifically, we first present\na novel sub-structure scheme to enable heterogeneous local model training\nconsidering different computing, memory, and communication constraints on LEO\nsatellites. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-synchronous model aggregation\nstrategy to dynamically schedule model aggregation for compensating model\nstaleness. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedSN, we evaluate\nit using space modulation recognition and remote sensing image classification\ntasks by leveraging the data from real-world satellite networks. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that FedSN framework achieves higher accuracy,\nlower computing, and communication overhead than the state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks and the effectiveness of each components in FedSN.\n","authors":["Zheng Lin","Zhe Chen","Zihan Fang","Xianhao Chen","Xiong Wang","Yue Gao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01483v3.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 17 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18756v1","updated":"2024-03-27T16:56:14Z","published":"2024-03-27T16:56:14Z","title":"Detection of subclinical atherosclerosis by image-based deep learning on\n  chest x-ray","summary":"  Aims. To develop a deep-learning based system for recognition of subclinical\natherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A\ndeep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the\nAI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20%\ninternal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median\nage 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed\ntomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3\nmonths. The CAC score calculated on chest CT was used as ground truth. The\nmodel was validated on an temporally-independent cohort of 90 patients from the\nsame institution (external validation). The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC\nmodel assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome.\nOverall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC.\nAUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation\ncohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort.

The presented\nmethodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that\nare trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific\ntimes, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the\ndata is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all\nindividuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be\napplied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated\ndataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling.

The effects of such heterogeneity\nplay an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to\ndiscover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from\nexperimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this\nend, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)\napproach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic\nmaterials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with\nthe material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation\nfield, from loading field-displacement field measurements. To this end, we\npropose a two-phase learning approach.

Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the\nkernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for\neach material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our\nHeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear\nand angular momentum guaranteed.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets.

To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty.

To address this scalability\nchallenge, we leverage the \"Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic\nrange imaging (R2D2)\" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging.\nR2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively\nestimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and\nassociated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned\nversion of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation,\nconsidering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary\nresults suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its\nunrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the\nnecessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior\nreconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based\napproximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to\nPnP, while only requiring few iterations.\n","authors":["Yiwei Chen","Chao Tang","Amir Aghabiglou","Chung San Chu","Yves Wiaux"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17905v2.pdf","comment":"submitted to IEEE EUSIPCO 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18370v1","updated":"2024-03-27T09:06:36Z","published":"2024-03-27T09:06:36Z","title":"Ship in Sight: Diffusion Models for Ship-Image Super Resolution","summary":"  In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in the field of\nimage generation, primarily driven by the escalating demand for high-quality\noutcomes across various image generation subtasks, such as inpainting,\ndenoising, and super resolution.

The convolutional neural network is used to represent spatial\ncorrelations of the mass-spring system, after which three branches are designed\nto learn linear, nonlinear, and time derivate features of cloth physics. The\nframework can also integrate with other external forces and collision handling\nthrough either traditional simulators or sub neural networks. The model is\ntested across different cloth animation cases, without training with new data.\nAgreement with baselines and predictive realism successfully validate its\ngeneralization ability. Inference efficiency of the proposed model also defeats\ntraditional physics simulation. This framework is also designed to easily\nintegrate with other visual refinement techniques like wrinkle carving, which\nleaves significant chances to incorporate prevailing macing learning techniques\nin 3D cloth amination.\n","authors":["Zhiwei Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12820v2.pdf","comment":"A derivation is incomplete, and updations are being processed"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18310v1","updated":"2024-03-27T07:22:32Z","published":"2024-03-27T07:22:32Z","title":"A thermodynamically consistent physics-informed deep learning material\n  model for short fiber/polymer nanocomposites","summary":"  This work proposes a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL)-based constitutive\nmodel for investigating the viscoelastic-viscoplastic behavior of short\nfiber-reinforced nanoparticle-filled epoxies under various ambient conditions.\nThe deep-learning model is trained to enforce thermodynamic principles, leading\nto a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model.

In this\npaper, we propose BridgeTower, which introduces multiple bridge layers that\nbuild a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer\nof the cross-modal encoder. This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal\nalignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different\nsemantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal encoders in the cross-modal encoder.\nPre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on various downstream vision-language tasks. In particular, on the\nVQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming\nthe previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training\ndata and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs.\nNotably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of\n81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger\ndatasets.

However, mitigating visual biases is challenging due to their\nunexplainable nature, often identified indirectly through visualization or\nsample statistics, which necessitates additional human supervision for\ninterpretation. To tackle this issue, we propose the Bias-to-Text (B2T)\nframework, which interprets visual biases as keywords. Specifically, we extract\ncommon keywords from the captions of mispredicted images to identify potential\nbiases in the model. We then validate these keywords by measuring their\nsimilarity to the mispredicted images using a vision-language scoring model.\nThe keyword explanation form of visual bias offers several advantages, such as\na clear group naming for bias discovery and a natural extension for debiasing\nusing these group names. Our experiments demonstrate that B2T can identify\nknown biases, such as gender bias in CelebA, background bias in Waterbirds, and\ndistribution shifts in ImageNet-R/C. Additionally, B2T uncovers novel biases in\nlarger datasets, such as Dollar Street and ImageNet. For example, we discovered\na contextual bias between \"bee\" and \"flower\" in ImageNet.

However,\nthis approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth\nhistopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs.\nRecently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by\ncombining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to\ndetect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In\nthis work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer\narchitectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a\ncomparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based\nprostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label\nnoise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer\nclassification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier\nwith MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that\nfor both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones\nlag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more\nnoticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can\nimprove performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a\nspecificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for\nmodelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust\nfeatures than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the\nbest architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an\neffective way to improve performance.\n","authors":["Mohamed Harmanani","Paul F. R.

This paper presents CAFE, a Compact, Adaptive,\nand Fast Embedding compression framework that addresses the above requirements.\nThe design philosophy of CAFE is to dynamically allocate more memory resources\nto important features (called hot features), and allocate less memory to\nunimportant ones. In CAFE, we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data\nstructure, named HotSketch, to capture feature importance and report hot\nfeatures in real time. For each reported hot feature, we assign it a unique\nembedding. For the non-hot features, we allow multiple features to share one\nembedding by using hash embedding technique.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field\nparameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions\nas well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views.

ICD contrasts distributions from\nstandard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty\nand effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original\ndistribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks\n(POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that\nICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level\nhallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also\nsignificantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of\nLVLMs.\n","authors":["Xintong Wang","Jingheng Pan","Liang Ding","Chris Biemann"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18715v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18714v1","updated":"2024-03-27T16:02:00Z","published":"2024-03-27T16:02:00Z","title":"Bringing Textual Prompt to AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment","summary":"  AI-Generated Images (AGIs) have inherent multimodal nature.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks. The results demonstrate that the visual tokens obtained by HOOK\ncorrespond to individual objects, which demonstrates homogeneity. HOOK\noutperformed Patch Embed by 6\\% and 10\\% in the two tasks and achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines used for comparison.\nCompared to Patch Embed, which requires more than one hundred tokens for one\nimage, HOOK requires only 6 and 8 tokens for sparse and dense tasks,\nrespectively, resulting in efficiency improvements of 1.5 to 2.8 times.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort. We also show that our sponge examples transfer between different neural\nnetworks.

Most\nmethods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under\nvariations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions)\nin the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images\noften have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as\nthe image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nMotivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in\nstructure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast\ninvariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel connected filtering that removes topologically equivalent nodes (i.e.\nconnected components) having no siblings in the Max/Min-tree. This results in\ntwo filtered images preserving topologically critical structure. Applying the\nproposed DSAIF to mutually supervised networks decreases the consensus of their\nerroneous predictions on unlabeled images.

Interestingly, even though they\ncommonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future\npaths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures\nfor each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can\nlead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory,\na diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the\nperformance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to\nunify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To\ndo this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion\npatterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive\nanchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods\nthat sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct\nanchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map.\nFinally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype\npaths using a cascaded denoising process.

While existing 3D hair modeling\nmethods have achieved impressive performance, the challenge of achieving\nhigh-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture\nconditions, making practical applications difficult, or heavily rely on learned\nprior data, obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MonoHair,a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity\nhair reconstruction from a monocular video, without specific requirements for\nenvironments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main\nstages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The\nexterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization\n(PMVO). This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from\nmultiple views, independent of prior data, to produce a high-fidelity exterior\n3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates\nthe inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior, we employ a\ndata-driven, multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D\nstructural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior, mirroring the\nsynthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges\nthe domain gap between our training data and real-world data, thereby enhancing\nthe accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly, we\ngenerate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair\ngrowth algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits\nrobustness across diverse hairstyles and achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nFor more results, please refer to our project page\nhttps://keyuwu-cs.github.io/MonoHair/.\n","authors":["Keyu Wu","Lingchen Yang","Zhiyi Kuang","Yao Feng","Xutao Han","Yuefan Shen","Hongbo Fu","Kun Zhou","Youyi Zheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18356v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by IEEE CVPR 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18351v1","updated":"2024-03-27T08:42:47Z","published":"2024-03-27T08:42:47Z","title":"Generating Diverse Agricultural Data for Vision-Based Farming\n  Applications","summary":"  We present a specialized procedural model for generating synthetic\nagricultural scenes, focusing on soybean crops, along with various weeds.

Recent studies have investigated various approaches to\noptimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint\nrepresentations.

In this research, we\nfocused mostly on our rigorous implementations and iterative result analysis of\ndifferent cutting-edge modified versions of EfficientNet architectures namely\nEfficientNet-V1 (b0-b7) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0-b3) with ultrasound image,\nnamed as CEIMVEN. We utilized transfer learning approach here for using the\npre-trained models of EfficientNet versions. We activated the hyper-parameter\ntuning procedures, added fully connected layers, discarded the unprecedented\noutliers and recorded the accuracy results from our custom modified\nEfficientNet architectures. Our deep learning model training approach was\nrelated to both identifying the cancer affected areas with region of interest\n(ROI) techniques and multiple classifications (benign, malignant and normal).\nThe approximate testing accuracies we got from the modified versions of\nEfficientNet-V1 (b0- 99.15%, b1- 98.58%, b2- 98.43%, b3- 98.01%, b4- 98.86%,\nb5- 97.72%, b6- 97.72%, b7- 98.72%) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0- 99.29%, b1-\n99.01%, b2- 98.72%, b3- 99.43%) are showing very bright future and strong\npotentials of deep learning approach for the successful detection and\nclassification of breast cancers from the ultrasound images at a very early\nstage.

However,\nprevious works commonly suffer from unreliable correlation caused by locally\nconstrained searching ranges, and struggle with accumulated inaccuracy arising\nfrom the coarse-to-fine structure. To alleviate these problems, we propose a\nnovel uncertainty-aware scene flow estimation network (DifFlow3D) with the\ndiffusion probabilistic model. Iterative diffusion-based refinement is designed\nto enhance the correlation robustness and resilience to challenging cases, e.g.\ndynamics, noisy inputs, repetitive patterns, etc. To restrain the generation\ndiversity, three key flow-related features are leveraged as conditions in our\ndiffusion model. Furthermore, we also develop an uncertainty estimation module\nwithin diffusion to evaluate the reliability of estimated scene flow. Our\nDifFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 24.0% and 29.1% EPE3D\nreduction respectively on FlyingThings3D and KITTI 2015 datasets. Notably, our\nmethod achieves an unprecedented millimeter-level accuracy (0.0078m in EPE3D)\non the KITTI dataset.

MSLM\njointly masks DS-terms and generic words, then learns mask-specific losses by\nensuring LMs incur larger penalties for inaccurately predicting DS-terms\ncompared to generic words. Results of our analysis show that MSLM improves LMs\nsensitivity and detection of DS-terms. We empirically show that an optimal\nmasking rate not only depends on the LM, but also on the dataset and the length\nof sequences. Our proposed masking strategy outperforms advanced masking\nstrategies such as span- and PMI-based masking.\n","authors":["Micheal Abaho","Danushka Bollegala","Gary Leeming","Dan Joyce","Iain E Buchan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18025v1.pdf","comment":"Paper alrerady accepted for publishing by the NAACL 2024 conference\n  (main conference paper)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18024v1","updated":"2024-03-26T18:22:05Z","published":"2024-03-26T18:22:05Z","title":"Enriching Word Usage Graphs with Cluster Definitions","summary":"  We present a dataset of word usage graphs (WUGs), where the existing WUGs for\nmultiple languages are enriched with cluster labels functioning as sense\ndefinitions.

A circuit is faithful if\nall model edges outside the circuit can be ablated without changing the model's\nperformance on the task; faithfulness is what justifies studying circuits,\nrather than the full model.

This pervasive issue perpetuates systemic inequalities, hindering\nthe pursuit of inclusive progress as a society. In this paper, we investigate\nthe presence of socioeconomic bias, if any, in large language models. To this\nend, we introduce a novel dataset SilverSpoon, consisting of 3000 samples that\nillustrate hypothetical scenarios that involve underprivileged people\nperforming ethically ambiguous actions due to their circumstances, and ask\nwhether the action is ethically justified. Further, this dataset has a\ndual-labeling scheme and has been annotated by people belonging to both ends of\nthe socioeconomic spectrum. Using SilverSpoon, we evaluate the degree of\nsocioeconomic bias expressed in large language models and the variation of this\ndegree as a function of model size. We also perform qualitative analysis to\nanalyze the nature of this bias. Our analysis reveals that while humans\ndisagree on which situations require empathy toward the underprivileged, most\nlarge language models are unable to empathize with the socioeconomically\nunderprivileged regardless of the situation. To foster further research in this\ndomain, we make SilverSpoon and our evaluation harness publicly available.\n","authors":["Smriti Singh","Shuvam Keshari","Vinija Jain","Aman Chadha"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14633v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08501v2","updated":"2024-03-26T06:23:30Z","published":"2024-03-13T13:08:16Z","title":"Governing Through the Cloud: The Intermediary Role of Compute Providers\n  in AI Regulation","summary":"  As jurisdictions around the world take their first steps toward regulating\nthe most powerful AI systems, such as the EU AI Act and the US Executive Order\n14110, there is a growing need for effective enforcement mechanisms that can\nverify compliance and respond to violations.

Compute providers can play an essential\nrole in a regulatory ecosystem via four key capacities: as securers,\nsafeguarding AI systems and critical infrastructure; as record keepers,\nenhancing visibility for policymakers; as verifiers of customer activities,\nensuring oversight; and as enforcers, taking actions against rule violations.\nWe analyze the technical feasibility of performing these functions in a\ntargeted and privacy-conscious manner and present a range of technical\ninstruments.

However,\ndevising optimal capacity strategies is complicated by fluctuating demand,\nconflicting objectives, and multifaceted practical constraints. This study\npresents a data-driven framework to optimize capacity management decisions\nwithin hospital systems during surge events. Two key decisions are optimized\nover a tactical planning horizon: allocating dedicated capacity to surge\npatients and transferring incoming patients between emergency departments (EDs)\nof hospitals to better distribute demand. The optimization models are\nformulated as robust mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient\ncomputation of optimal decisions that are robust against demand uncertainty.\nThe models incorporate practical constraints and costs, including setup times\nand costs for adding surge capacity, restrictions on ED patient transfers, and\nrelative costs of different decisions that reflect impacts on care quality and\noperational efficiency. The methodology is evaluated retrospectively in a\nhospital system during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate the\npotential impact of the recommended decisions. The results show that optimally\nallocating beds and transferring just 30 patients over a 63 day period around\nthe peak, less than one transfer every two days, could have reduced the need\nfor surge capacity in the hospital system by approximately 98%. Overall, this\nwork introduces a practical tool to transform capacity management\ndecision-making, enabling proactive planning and the use of data-driven\nrecommendations to improve outcomes.\n","authors":["Felix Parker","Fardin Ganjkhanloo","Diego A.

Examining real-life applications benefit learning practical ethics\nin many situations, offering valuable data to grasp the complexities of human\nethics in diverse contexts. In this paper, we examine social media platforms\nfor understanding real-life ethical scenarios and human moral judgments. We\nexamine posts from a popular Reddit subreddit (i.e., a subcommunity) called\nr/AmITheAsshole, where authors and commenters share their moral judgments on\nwho is blameworthy. We employ computational techniques to investigate the\nunderlying reasoning influencing moral judgments. We focus on excerpts-which we\nterm moral sparks-from original posts that commenters include to indicate what\nmotivates their judgments. To this end, we examine how (1) events activating\nsocial commonsense and (2) linguistic signals affect moral sparks assignment\nand their subsequent judgments. By examining over 24 672 posts and 175988\ncomments, we find that event-related negative character traits (e.g., immature\nand rude) attract attention and stimulate blame, implying a dependent\nrelationship between character traits and moral values. Specially, we focus on\ncausal graph involving events (c-events) that activate social commonsense. We\nobserve that c-events are perceived with varying levels of informativeness,\ninfluencing moral spark and judgment assignment in distinct ways. This\nobservation is reinforced by examining linguistic features describing\nsemantically similar c-events. Moreover, language influencing commenters'\ncognitive processes enhances the probability of an excerpt becoming a moral\nspark, while factual and concrete descriptions tend to inhibit this effect.\n","authors":["Ruijie Xi","Munindar P.

While the recent works have addressed this\nquestion in the context of police-civilian interactions using police stop data,\nthey have two key limitations. First, bias can only be properly quantified if\ntrue criminality is accounted for in addition to race, but it is absent in\nprior works. Second, law enforcement systems are multi-stage and hence it is\nimportant to isolate the true source of bias within the \"causal chain of\ninteractions\" rather than simply focusing on the end outcome; this can help\nguide reforms. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a\nmulti-stage causal framework incorporating criminality. We provide a\ntheoretical characterization and an associated data-driven method to evaluate\n(a) the presence of any form of racial bias, and (b) if so, the primary source\nof such a bias in terms of race and criminality. Our framework identifies three\ncanonical scenarios with distinct characteristics: in settings like (1) airport\nsecurity, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be\nbias in law enforcement against innocents of that race; (2) AI-empowered\npolicing, the primary source of observed bias against a race is likely to be\nbias in law enforcement against criminals of that race; and (3) police-civilian\ninteraction, the primary source of observed bias against a race could be bias\nin law enforcement against that race or bias from the general public in\nreporting against the other race. Through an extensive empirical study using\npolice-civilian interaction data and 911 call data, we find an instance of such\na counter-intuitive phenomenon: in New Orleans, the observed bias is against\nthe majority race and the likely reason for it is the over-reporting (via 911\ncalls) of incidents involving the minority race by the general public.\n","authors":["Jessy Xinyi Han","Andrew Miller","S.

To build trustworthy GNNs, two aspects -\nfairness and privacy - have emerged as critical considerations. Previous\nstudies have separately examined the fairness and privacy aspects of GNNs,\nrevealing their trade-off with GNN performance. Yet, the interplay between\nthese two aspects remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration\nof the interaction between the privacy risks of edge leakage and the individual\nfairness of a GNN. Our theoretical analysis unravels that edge privacy risks\nunfortunately escalate when the nodes' individual fairness improves. Such an\nissue hinders the accomplishment of privacy and fairness of GNNs at the same\ntime. To balance fairness and privacy, we carefully introduce fairness-aware\nloss reweighting based on influence function and privacy-aware graph structure\nperturbation modules within a fine-tuning mechanism. Experimental results\nunderscore the effectiveness of our approach in achieving GNN fairness with\nlimited performance compromise and controlled privacy risks. This work\ncontributes to the comprehensively developing trustworthy GNNs by\nsimultaneously addressing both fairness and privacy aspects.\n","authors":["He Zhang","Xingliang Yuan","Shirui Pan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12951v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)\n  2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13275v1","updated":"2024-03-20T03:19:51Z","published":"2024-03-20T03:19:51Z","title":"Analysing Guarantees in Australian Senate Outcomes","summary":"  Single Transferable Vote (STV) is used to elect candidates to the 76 seat\nAustralian Senate across six states and two territories. These eight STV\ncontests are counted using a combination of ballot scanners, manual data entry\nand tabulation software. On election night, some properties of the set of cast\nballots are determined by hand. This includes the first preference tallies of\neach party. This technical report considers whether there are some properties,\nsuch as individual candidates' first preference tallies, that, if assumed to be\naccurate, imply a portion of the election outcome. The paper also presents an\ninteresting example showing that the rules of STV tabulation used for the\nAustralian Senate can allow bizarre behaviour, such as votes increasing in\nvalue over time.\n","authors":["Michelle Blom"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13275v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13272v1","updated":"2024-03-20T03:14:54Z","published":"2024-03-20T03:14:54Z","title":"Community Needs and Assets: A Computational Analysis of Community\n  Conversations","summary":"  A community needs assessment is a tool used by non-profits and government\nagencies to quantify the strengths and issues of a community, allowing them to\nallocate their resources better. Such approaches are transitioning towards\nleveraging social media conversations to analyze the needs of communities and\nthe assets already present within them. However, manual analysis of\nexponentially increasing social media conversations is challenging. There is a\ngap in the present literature in computationally analyzing how community\nmembers discuss the strengths and needs of the community. To address this gap,\nwe introduce the task of identifying, extracting, and categorizing community\nneeds and assets from conversational data using sophisticated natural language\nprocessing methods. To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset\nabout community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit,\nannotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an\nutterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a\npopular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our\nmodel outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61%\nrespectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations\nabout needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about\nassets focus on location and entities.

While prior studies have focused on EV\ncharging demand prediction, primarily for public charging stations using\nhistorical charging data, home charging prediction is equally essential.\nHowever, existing prediction methods may not be suitable due to the\nunavailability of or limited access to home charging data. To address this\nresearch gap, inspired by the concept of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM),\nwe develop a home charging prediction method using historical smart meter data.\nDifferent from NILM detecting EV charging that has already occurred, our method\nprovides predictive information of future EV charging occurrences, thus\nenhancing its utility for charging management. Specifically, our method,\nleverages a self-attention mechanism-based transformer model, employing a\n``divide-conquer'' strategy, to process historical meter data to effectively\nand learn EV charging representation for charging occurrence prediction. Our\nmethod enables prediction at one-minute interval hour-ahead. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving consistently\nhigh accuracy of over 96.81\\% across different prediction time spans. Notably,\nour method achieves high prediction performance solely using smart meter data,\nmaking it a practical and suitable solution for grid operators.\n","authors":["Fucai Ke","Hao Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13246v1.pdf","comment":"2024 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)"}]}}
